        <h2>Crispy Lamb Salad</h2>
        <p>Crispy shreds of lamb paired with creamy feta, crunchy red onion and tangy roasted tomatoes, all finished off with a simple balsamic dressing. My absolute favourite salad of all time and hands down the best way to use up those roast dinner leftovers! Gluten free, super fast to throw together, and filling enough for dinner!</p>

        <h2>Pumpkim soup</h2>
        <p>This pumpkin soup recipe is creamy AND healthy! It calls for roasted pumpkin for maximum flavor. This roasted pumpkin soup recipe would look lovely on your holiday dinner table, and leftovers would go great with sandwiches or salads the next day. Recipe yields 4 bowls or 6 cups of soup.</p>
